Ideas for the final project:

Professional portfolio with animations, and social media APIs.

Goal: I want to impress the viewers of my portfolio.

Audience: current customers, future customers, recruiters, future employers, friends, professional network.

Functional specifications:
* Animated navigation on the home page: Each navigational button will be an interactive leave of a flower;

* Responsive designs
