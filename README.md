Final-project
=============

Lab questions - May 1:

1. The person who will use my project is: clients(current/future); recruiters; future employers; friends.

2. These people will be happy my project exist if:
     - they are able to find all the info they need;
     - they are impressed of the interactions and the uniqueness of it;
     - they can browse my lab;

3. The first 10 min interacting with my project will look like:
     - home page: interacting with the flower navigation;
     - looking at my resume extracted from linkedin with an API;
     - looking at my projects;
     - looking at my social network widgets: interactive data visualized using APIs and processing;

4. By the able of tonight I would like to be able to complete big part of the home page and the navigation for the other pages.

Questions:
I did not get any question

==============

Ideas for the final project:

Professional portfolio with animations, and social media APIs.

Motivation: For a long time I am planning to update my outdated professional portfolio. I want to use what I learned in this class to redesign my portfolio. Specificly, I want to use css animations, canvas with processing, and APIs of Linkedin, Tweeter, Google, Facebook and maybe others.

Goal: I want to impress the viewers of my portfolio.

Audience: current customers, future customers, recruiters, future employers, friends, professional network.

Functional specifications:
* Animated navigation on the home page: Each navigational button will be an interactive leave of a flower;
* APIs: I want to have social media widgets in the contact page;
* APIs: I want to visualize with processing my comunication/network.
* Responsive designs


Lab questions - May 8:

By the end of tonight, I want to create a linkedin post widget.



By the end of the next 7 days, I want to:
- finish my site navigation: create one more navigational flower that will link to my social media accounts;
- I want to embed Facebook and Tweeter widget on my contact page;
- rotate the navigation text to look horizontal;
-to register Linkedin API for all my pages. I want to say: “Hello <user name>” on the top of each page of my website. Users who happen to be logged in to linked in already will be able to see this greeting. For example recruiters have their linked in account launched most of the time. This mean they will be able to see this interactive greeting. 

Will try to fit in the next 7 days:
If all this takes me less time than the estimated time: I want to create a widget where I can take all my posts from Tweeter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and stack them one after another sorted by timestamp.

=================
It turns our that linked's architecture does not support public view of network updates for member posts. I did just a mock-up simulation of the widget.
